Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the documentation portal for first time Pachyderm users! We've organized information into three major sections:

:doc:`local_installation`: Get Pachyderm deployed locally on OSX or Linux.

:doc:`beginner_tutorial`: Learn to use Pachdyerm through a quick and simple tutorial.

:doc:`troubleshooting`: Common getting started issues and how to fix them.


If you'd like to read about the technical concepts in Pachyderm before actually running it, check out our reference docs:

* :doc:`../reference/pachyderm_file_system` 
* :doc:`../reference/pachyderm_pipeline_system` 
* :doc:`../pachctl/pachctl` 
* `Use Cases <http://pachyderm.io/use_cases.html>`_
